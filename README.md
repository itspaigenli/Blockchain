# CIRCLE - SocialFi Platform on HeLa Blockchain

CIRCLE is a next-generation SocialFi platform built on the EVM-compatible HeLa blockchain, designed to merge the familiarity of Web2 social media with the ownership, incentives, and transparency of Web3.

At its core, CIRCLE offers a full-fledged social experience: profiles, posts, engagement, discovery, and referrals, while enabling users to earn real value for meaningful participation. Instead of passive scrolling, every action on CIRCLE contributes to on-chain reputation and rewards.

The platform is powered by its native token, **$YAP**, which functions as both an incentive and utility layer within the ecosystem.

## 🎁 Reward System

CIRCLE incentivizes genuine user engagement through blockchain-based rewards:

- **Registration Reward**: New users receive **1 $YAP token** when they join the platform
- **Post Rewards**: Users earn **1 $YAP token** for every **10 posts** they create
- **On-Chain Tracking**: All rewards and user activity are transparently recorded on the HeLa blockchain
- **Wallet Integration**: Seamlessly connect with MetaMask to receive and manage your $YAP tokens

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- MongoDB
- MetaMask wallet
- HeLa testnet tokens (for deployment)

### 1. Blockchain Setup

```bash
cd blockchain

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Add your private key to .env

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to HeLa Testnet
npx tsx scripts/deploy-with-ethers.ts
```

### 2. Server Setup

```bash
cd server

# Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Configure MongoDB URL, JWT secret, etc.

# Start server
npm start
```

### 3. Client Setup

```bash
cd client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file (if needed)
# Configure API endpoint

# Start development server
npm start
```

## 📝 Development Workflow

1. **Smart Contract Development**
   - Write contracts in `blockchain/contracts/`
   - Test with `npx hardhat test`
   - Deploy to testnet

2. **Backend Integration**
   - Update controllers to call smart contract
   - Use ethers.js or web3.js for blockchain interaction
   - Trigger `registerUser()` on user signup
   - Trigger `recordPost()` on post creation

3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Connect MetaMask wallet
   - Display user's $YAP balance
   - Show reward progress
   - Enable token transfers

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` files
- Keep private keys secure
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Audit smart contracts before mainnet deployment
